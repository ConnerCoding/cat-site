        <h2>What Am I?</h2>
        <p>I am a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal. The only domesticated species in
            the family <i>Felidae</i> and often referred to as the <b>domestic cat</b> to distinguish
            it from the wild (not-as-cool) members of the family. I am specifically of the <b>house cat</b> 
            variety, as opposed to a farm cat or feral cat (gross!). I am valued by my humans for companionship 
            and my ability to hunt vicious rodents (they call them "toys"?). In other words, 
            I am <strong>awesome</strong>.

                <p>Sometimes I like to lay around with my good friend Lambo - he doesn't talk much
                    but he is always around when I need him the most for bath time.

                <p>When I'm not laying around with Lambo I spend quality time cuddling with
                    Mousey. Sometimes my claws dig a little too deep but I think he likes it.
